        <p>I'm always on the lookout for opportunities to work with intelligent, innovative, and values-driven tech organizations to scale design and content teams, create award-winning marketing campaigns, and generally help teams kick creative ass.</p>

        <p>For the past few years, I've worked as a Producer for Oscar Health's Marketing team. I've been involved in some big wins here <a url="https://link.html">this</a>, <a url="https://link.html">this</a>, and <a url="https://link.html">this</a>. Before that, I was at Kickstarter, where I managed asset production and implementation of brand guidelines for Outreach, Events, Education, and Production teams. Before I moved into the tech world, I worked agency-side with a wide range of clients including Diane Von Furstenburg, Macys, the NFL, JP Morgan, Bloomingdales, Scholastic, Disney Publishing, Barnes and Noble, Reiss, Verizon, and Harry Winston. <a href="contact.html">Let's get in touch!</a></p>
